      Number with same-slice carry load:         2
      Number with other load:                    1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    84 out of     600   14%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        40 out of   1,200    3%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          252
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            53 out of     252   21%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             136 out of   4,800    2%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
